# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains an analysis in Python to predict customer churn of a bank using supervised machine learning algorithms.

## Description
The goal of the project is to build several models to predict churn, and compare the performance of the models in order to decide which model to use.

## Libraries
The project is implementing libraries namely:
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/).

## Files
1. `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and modeling.
2. `/data`: The directory containing the datasets in csv format that are used in the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open the `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb` using Jupyter notebook.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the project.

## Dependencies
The project requires the following dependencies:

1. Python 3.x
2. SQL Alchemy
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
4. Scikitlearn
3. XGBoost
