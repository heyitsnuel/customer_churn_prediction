# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains an analysis in Python to predict customer churn of a bank using supervised machine learning algorithms.

## Description
The goal of the project is to build several models to predict churn, and compare the performance of the models in order to decide which model to use.

## Libraries
The project is implementing libraries namely:
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html)
- [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
- [Scikit Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
  - [Label Encoder](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.LabelEncoder.html)
  - [Robust Scaler](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.RobustScaler.html)
  - [Logistic Regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html)
  - [Decision Tree](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html)
  - [Random Forest](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
- [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)

## Files
1. `customer_churn_prediction.ipynb`: The Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and modeling.
2. `/data`: The directory containing the datasets in csv format that are used in the project.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
